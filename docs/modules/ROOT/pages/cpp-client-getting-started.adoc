:description: This tutorial will get you started with the Hazelcast C++ client.

== What You'll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

* A text editor or IDE
* Docker
* C++ 11+ supporting compiler
* Vcpkg

== Start a Hazelcast Member

We will use the 5.1 version of Hazelcast for this tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will use Docker for simplicity. You can also use https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/getting-started/get-started-cli[CLI], https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/getting-started/get-started-binary[Binary] and https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/getting-started/get-started-java[Maven].

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1
----

This will start a new Hazelcast member at port 5701. Now, we have a Hazelcast cluster with just one member.

== Install Hazelcast C++ Client
In this tutorial we will use Vcpkg for installing the C++ client. You can also use https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#111-conan-users[Conan] or install from source using CMake as explained https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#113-install-from-source-code-using-cmake[here].

Before starting download and install Vcpkg itself if you haven't already: +
for Windows;
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
----

for non-Windows;
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
----
First, execute the following to install `hazelcast-cpp-client` with its `boost` dependency: +
for Windows;
[source,bash]
----
.\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install hazelcast-cpp-client
----
for non-Windows;
[source,bash]
----
./vcpkg/vcpkg install hazelcast-cpp-client
----

After the installation, the library is available for usage.
For example, if you are using CMake for your builds, you can use the following cmake build command with the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` cmake option to be the `vcpkg.cmake`.

[source,bash]
----
cmake -B [build directory] -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build [build directory]
----
For more information about Vcpkg installation check https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#112-vcpkg-users[here].

== Starting the C++ Client
In this tutorial we use CMake for compilation, for other options you can check https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client/blob/master/Reference_Manual.md#13-compiling-your-project[here].
If you are using CMake like we do, you can easily find and link against the client library:
[source]
----
find_package(hazelcast-cpp-client CONFIG REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE hazelcast-cpp-client::hazelcast-cpp-client)
----
Make sure you add the installation prefix of the client library to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH if you are using a custom installation location.

Then, You can include the library and start a client using the following code:
[source,cpp]
----
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>

int main() {
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get();
    return 0;
}
----

The following line creates and starts a new Hazelcast C++ client with the default configuration.

[source,cpp]
----
auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get();
----

The client automatically connects to the Hazelcast member available on the local machine. Client also automatically disconnects upon its destruction.

== Use Map

A Hazelcast map is a distributed key-value store, similar to JavaScript Map class or plain objects. You can store key-value pairs in a map.
In the following example, we will work with map entries where the keys are session ids and the values are emails.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>

int main() {
    auto hz = hazelcast::new_client().get();
    auto map = hz.get_map("some_map").get();
    map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12345","example1@email.com");
    map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12346","example2@email.com");
    std::cout << map->get<std::string,std::string>("sid12345").get() << std::endl;
    std::cout << map->get<std::string,std::string>("sid12346").get() << std::endl;
}
----

The output of this snippet is given below:

[source,bash]
----
example1@email.com
example2@email.com
----

The following line returns a map proxy object for the 'some_map' map:

[source,cpp]
----
auto map = hz.get_map("some_map").get();
----

If the map called “some_map” does not exist in the Hazelcast cluster, it will be automatically created. All the clients that connect to the same cluster will have access to the same map.

With these two lines, the C++ client adds data to the map. The first parameter is the key of the entry, the second one is the value:

[source,cpp]
----
map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12345","example1@email.com");
map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12346","example2@email.com");
----

Finally, we get the values we added to the map with the get method:

[source,cpp]
----
std::cout << map->get<std::string,std::string>("sid12345").get() << std::endl;
std::cout << map->get<std::string,std::string>("sid12346").get() << std::endl;
----

== Add a Listener to the Map

You can add an entry listener using the “add_entry_listener” method available on map proxy object.
This will allow you to listen to certain events that happen in the map across the cluster.

The first argument to the “add_entry_listener” method is an object that is used to define listeners.
In this example, we registered listeners for the “on_added”, “on_removed" and “on_updated” events.

The second argument in the add_entry_listener method is `include_value`. It is a boolean parameter, and if it is true, the entry event contains the entry value.
In this example, it will be true.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <hazelcast/client/hazelcast_client.h>

int main(){
    auto client = hazelcast::new_client().get();
    auto map = client.get_map("some_map").get();

    map->add_entry_listener(
            hazelcast::client::entry_listener().on_added([](hazelcast::client::entry_event &&event) {
                std::cout << "Entry added. Key:" << event.get_key().get<std::string>() << " Value: " << event.get_value().get<std::string>() << std::endl;
            }).on_removed([](hazelcast::client::entry_event &&event) {
                std::cout << "Entry removed. Key: " << event.get_key().get<std::string>() << std::endl;
            }).on_updated([](hazelcast::client::entry_event &&event) {
                std::cout << "Entry updated. Key: " << event.get_key().get<std::string>() << " Value change: "  << event.get_old_value().get<std::string>() << " -> " << event.get_value().get<std::string>() <<  std::endl;
            }), true).get();

    map->clear().get();

    map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12345", "example1@email.com").get();
    map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12346", "example2@email.com").get();
    map->delete_entry("sid12345").get();
    map->put<std::string,std::string>("sid12346", "example1@email.com").get();
}
----

First, the map is cleared to fire events even if there are some entries in the map. Then, two session entries are added, and they are logged.
After that, we remove one of the entries and update the other one. Then, we log the session entries again.

The output is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
Entry added. Key: sid12345 Value: example1@email.com
Entry added. Key: sid12346 Value: example2@email.com
Entry removed. Key: sid12345
Entry updated. Key: sid12346 Value change: example2@email.com -> example1@email.com
----
